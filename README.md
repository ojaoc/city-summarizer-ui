# City Summarizer

### Useful app to obtain information about any city

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## System requirements

- Node.js 12.0 or later
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported

## Getting Started

First, in project directory

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

This installs required dependencies to run the app. Then, we need to build the application

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Afterwards, run

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Server

If your goal is development, install the dependencies and then run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.

The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
